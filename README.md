### Oddmap+ - The Text Adventure Game Engine
---
# What is Oddmap+?
Oddmap+ is a fork of [The original Oddmap Project](https://github.com/fisik-yum/oddmap) by [fisik-yum](https://github.com/fisik-yum) that turns the Original Project into an entire Game Engine library.
# API
Currently, I ***DO NOT*** plan to create API documentation as the API is still a Work-in-Progress, though I will create the documentation once I think that the API is almost finished.
# Building from Source code
To build the source code, you only need to run `go build`.
